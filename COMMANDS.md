# Commands

There are many commands available to help you build and test sites. Here are a few highlights to get started with.


## Run locally

```
grunt serve
```

This will have Jekyll build the site, run a static server, and watch for changes to site files. Every change will cause Jekyll to rebuild the affected files.

Also, you can run The Map Academy website locally as if it was on staging with `grunt serve --target=staging`


## Build & Optimize

```
grunt build
```

Build and optimize the current site, ready for deployment. This includes image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.


## Deploy

```
grunt deploy --target=ENV
```

Compress assets and upload them to the corrsponding S3 bucket, as well as the HTML files generated by Jekyll.
