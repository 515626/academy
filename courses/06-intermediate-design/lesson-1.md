## Which kind of map should I make?

Congratulations, if you completed our last [course](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/02-design-for-beginners.html) you've learned the basics of how to design digital maps using filtered data, color and labels! You saw an [example](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/02-design-for-beginners/lesson-2.html#why-to-think-about-colors) of how design choices can [obscure](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/02-design-for-beginners/lesson-3.html#data-how-much-is-too-much) or [clearly communicate](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/02-design-for-beginners/lesson-3.html#all-together-now) your dataset’s information.

Our Editor’s [wizards](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#map-wizards) make it easy for you to filter and style your data, but which one should you use?
That depends on what you’re trying to make your data illustrate. This lesson will help you pick a wizard by outlining when to use each—and when not to.

### A good starting point

There’s no exact formula for building a map, but asking yourself these questions can help narrow down design options. Keep the answers in mind as you’re learning about each wizard.

1. Do you want your audience to pick out specific information from your map, or general? For example, do you want them to focus specifically on the magnitudes of San Francisco's most recent earthquakes, or do you want them to generally compare regions and see that South America has more earthquakes relative to Africa?
2. Is your data best represented by points, lines or polygons? Consider scale: for instance, if you’re planning a [small-scale map](http://www.gislounge.com/understanding-scale/), will some polygons be too small to see?
