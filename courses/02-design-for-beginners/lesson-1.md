##Getting Started with Map Design

Welcome to Course 2 of Map Academy! Here we will start talking about designing your data for maps. This won't be a one-stop guide to all things map design, but will cover a few basic concepts to get you started. 

We will be talking about designing for the web, and about designing the data that will go on your maps. Remember that this is just the tip of the map design iceberg!

###Thinking About Design for Maps
NYPL Maps
Display geography and data an top of it. Maps color labels and scale
Cartography isn't simple
Lots of concepts

Starting with [google maps](http://bit.ly/1r4PW3A)

[Tilemill](http://bit.ly/1mdl4jE) building basemaps really fast 

[Stamen](http://bit.ly/1i2aeoG) great digital cartography and basemaps that you can use

[D3](http://bit.ly/1lgkQnY) - [projections](http://bit.ly/1kLKFMh)newcommer 

Think about projections

Animated maps [wind example](http://hint.fm/wind) and adding a lot to the discussion

We'll look at Colors (on maps), Data (what to use and show), Labels (used often, need to know how they can work)
