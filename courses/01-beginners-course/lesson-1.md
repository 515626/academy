When using a baseline grid, the first thing you must decide on is your baseline grid unit. You’ll commonly see baseline grid values of something like 20px, but where does a value like that come from?

As you might have guessed, most designers choose this unit arbitrarily. The problem with this approach is that the resulting baseline grid unit is not directly related to the primary font size, which is the most fundamental design element on the page.
