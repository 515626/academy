#Lesson 5: Multilayer Visualizations

- Using both the US cities and the tornados data

##Creating a Two-Layer Map
- Go to counties, create viz
- Remember, if you want you can add description
- You should have infowindows, but if not, can add them now
- In viz, add tornado layer (button at the top, appears best when you pull out the tray on the right)
- Brings up a menu, we're going to add an existing table
- You can drag one on top of the other to change which is rendered on top and which is on bottom
- You can style the layers independently
- Do play around with the different layers to see what you can come up with: change colors, opacity, and order of layer

###Publishing with Two Layers
- You can toggle this on/off so your user can decide whether or not to see both layers

##Editing Legends
- Add own description
