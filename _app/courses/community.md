# Community lessons and tutorials

There are countless lessons and tutorials written for CartoDB. Here we collect some contributed by the community or ones we found and want to include. **See the stellar list of entries below.**

## Want to contribute a lesson?

If you would like to nominate a new lesson for inclusion to our community section, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13KyJ2qzQvIc0FXJ34v1TUZydxk4eoZzhHEnBm2dhu3s/viewform?usp=send_form).

## Want to contribute in another way?

Map Academy is open source. What that means is that all lessons and code to create Map Academy lies in [our code repository](http://github.com/CartoDB/academy).

### Ways to contribute

1. Open issues if you find typos, incorrect directions, old screen captures, and more! You can open an issue at the following page: <a href="https://github.com/CartoDB/academy/issues/new">https://github.com/CartoDB/academy/issues/new</a>
2. Open a <a href="https://github.com/CartoDB/academy/compare">Pull Request</a> to fix the problem you found in #1
3. Create new content to make Map Academy more full-featured. If you do this, we'll buy you lunch if you come to visit our office in New York! If you can't visit us, we can send swag anywhere in the world.
