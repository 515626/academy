# CartoDB.js from the ground up

This introduction to CartoDB.js from the ground up will take you through the common uses of the library. You'll start out by pulling your maps from CartoDB with only a few lines of code. Later you'll customize your maps with JavaScript, interact with the data, add custom SQL queries, integrate other features, and much more.
