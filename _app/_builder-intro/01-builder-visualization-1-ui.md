Welcome to the exciting new CARTO Builder! In this lesson, we will give you an overview of the Builder. When you log in to CARTO, the Datasets and Maps Dashboards on your account will appear similar. Where you'll see the exciting features of the new CARTO Builder is when you create a new map. Let's get started!

## Builder Features

The CARTO Builder pane is located on the left side of the screen. You will see Basemap and Data Layers in the **LAYERS** tab. Above this are the **ELEMENTS** and **WIDGETS** tabs.

### Layers
In the Builder, **LAYERS** are referenced as letters. Layers are named alphabetically (A, B, C, D and so on) and each layer displays a unique color. Learn more about [LAYERS in the Builder Documentation]({{site.url}}/docs/carto-builder/introduction-to-the-builder/#layers). Layers may be reordered by clicking and dragging.

In the top-right corner of the layer, you may show or hide or delete it.

### Basemap and Labels as layers
The CARTO Builder includes the **Basemap** and **Labels** as a layer. You can turn data layers on or off by clicking the eye-shaped icon and have more options by clicking the three-dot icon.

### Adding layers
And in the top-right of the Builder pane, you can use the **ADD** button to add a layer to your map. You can select existing datasets you have in CARTO or connect a new data layer.

## Layer Options

Click on a layer to get a new view of the layer options and explore your data. In the layer options the following options for data exploration are; **DATA, ANALYSIS, STYLE, POP-UP and LEGEND**. Learn more about [Styling Map Layers](https://carto.com/docs/carto-builder/styling-map-layers/)

## Data 
You can learn more about the [LAYERS options from the CARTO Introduction to the Builder in our website Documentation section](https://carto.com/docs/carto-builder/introduction-to-the-builder/#layers). The **DATA** view will immediately display some potential **WIDGET** options that may be added to your map visualization. [Learn more about WIDGETS in the Documentation section in the CARTO website](https://carto.com/docs/carto-builder/introduction-to-the-builder/#widgets). You'll see some high level statistics generated on the fly in the Data view.

## Data View
When you're working in the Map Data view you can also access the Layers data view by clicking the data view button in the bottom center of your map. You'll have access to the column views and are able to edit the data. Toggle back to the Map view by hitting the pushpin icon.

## SQL Pane


To access the familiar SQL pane, select the slider from **VALUES** and slide it over to **SQL** in the bottom left corner of the layer pane.

### SQL 

Just as in the Editor, you can write and edit your SQL statements related to your data tables. All the familiar and useful functions from the editor are still available in the Builder along with some other features that will be sure to improve your mapping and analysis in the CARTO platform. Read up in our Doc's section about [Applying Code in the Builder](https://carto.com/docs/carto-builder/applying-code-in-the-builder/).
