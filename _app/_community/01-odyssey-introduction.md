[CartoDB's Odyssey](http://mapninja.github.io/CartoDB_Odyssey_Tutorial_for_Story_Maps/)

<div class="Lesson-info">
  <p>This tutorial was written by Stace Maples, the Geospatial Manager at <a href="http://gis.stanford.edu/">The Stanford Geospatial Center</a>, Stanford University and the former GIS Specialist &amp; Instruction Coordinator for Yale University. He provides support and collaboration to the Stanford research community in capturing and making sense of the "where" of their work. His work mapping the research interests of scholars has taken him from the beaches of Martha's Vineyard, to Kurdish Northeastern Syria, to the most remote areas of the Mongolian/Chinese border.</p>
  <p>An archaeologist by training and a technologist by temperament, he is interested in all aspects of mapping, from the aerial imaging of archaeological sites using kites and balloons, to the development of platforms for the gathering of volunteer geographic information. He has over 18 years of experience using Geographic Information Systems and Geotechnology for research and teaching.</p>
