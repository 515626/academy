# Identify Retail Opportunities by Location

Learn how to visualize new retail opportunities in New York City by building a real world map application. Use the Builder to analyze data of Starbucks stores, located near high-foot traffic areas near NYC subways, to identify new retail opportunities for Starbucks locations.

**Analysis options**:

- Create areas of influence
- Enrich from the Data Observatory
- Filter points in polygons

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with importing data to CARTO Builder and creating multi-layer map visualizations gained through [this lesson](tbd).

**writer note_csobier:** Example of workflow navigation for Design, you can create anything similar. You can skip around to different sections, you are not forced to take a guided course consecutively. Sections in the workflow are high-level, to guide the users towards the end result.

## Why use Location Data?

Most public data typically contains 80% of location-based information. Location-based data is not just for cartographers or geographic information system (GIS) specialist. Understanding how to leverage your location-based intelligence into something that you can visualize enables you to gain key insights about your data, that you may have otherwise missed.

[CARTO Builder](https://vimeo.com/173591785) not only enables you to find location-based data, it converts your data to geometries. Allowing you to style, analyze, and visualize the hidden values that your data contains. This is useful since the geometry of your data controls how features are visualized.

## Analyzing your Data

There are no particular requirements when adding analyses. This is where you get to put on your analytical thinking cap and explore your data. This section describes why each analysis is being applied in this use case.

### Create Areas of Influence

Overview of this analysis, and why it is being applied for this use case? 

Describe hypothesis with a list of questions, a table, or workflow diagram, and how using the Builder analysis is a solution.

### Enrich form the Data Observatory

Overview of this analysis, and why it is being applied for this use case.

### Filter Points in Polygons

Overview of this analysis, and why it is being applied for this use case.

(Discuss importance of chaining analysis as part of a workflow)

## Creating a Map of NYC Subways and Starbucks Locations

Create a map with two layers, by using the CARTO teams' public profile page to download a .carto file.

Connect the following datasets and create a map:

- NYC Subway stations dataset, `subways_stations_1_2`
- Starbucks locations in NYC dataset, `starbucks_2`

The following image displays the initial map containing two layers with NYC subway entrances and existing Starbucks stores.

**Tip:** If you need help creating this map, follow [this procedure](#procedure).
**writer note_csobier:** Is there a way to expand/collapse content? For example, default appears collapsed. Click on "Procedure" to expand and view the steps below.

Now that you understand the workflow, you can use your own data to identify retail or market opportunities.
