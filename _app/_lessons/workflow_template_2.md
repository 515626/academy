# Identify Retail Opportunities by Location

This lesson describes how to create a map and visualize market opportunities based on identifying and filtering areas of interest in your location data.

Use Case: Suppose you want to identify where to open up a new Starbucks location near high-pedestrian areas in New York City. Create a multi-layer map showing all NYC subway entrances and existing Starbucks stores to analyze where missing retail opportunities might exist.

**writer note_csobier:** Design to create some kind of button, or font, or color for Use Case?

**writer note_csobier:** Example of workflow navigation for Design, you can create anything similar. You can skip around to different sections, you are not forced to take a guided course consecutively. Sections in the workflow are high-level, to guide the users towards the end result.

------ Each subsequent section should be a new section in the lesson ---

## Why use Location Data?

Most public data typically contains 80% of location-based information. Location-based data is not just for cartographers or geographic information system (GIS) specialist. Understanding how to leverage your location-based intelligence into something that you can visualize enables you to gain key insights about your data, that you may have otherwise missed.

[CARTO Builder](https://vimeo.com/173591785) not only enables you to find location-based data, it converts your data to geometries. Allowing you to style, analyze, and visualize the hidden values that your data contains. This is useful since the geometry of your data controls how features are visualized.

## Creating a Map of NYC Subways and Starbucks Locations

Create a map with two layers, by using the CARTO teams' public profile page to download a .carto file.

Connect the following datasets and create a map:

- NYC Subway stations dataset, `subways_stations_1_2`
- Starbucks locations in NYC dataset, `starbucks_2`

The following image displays the initial map containing two layers with NYC subway entrances and existing Starbucks stores.

**Tip:** If you need help creating this map, follow [this procedure](#procedure).
**writer note_csobier:** Is there a way to expand/collapse content? For example, default appears collapsed. Click on "Procedure" to expand and view the steps below.

Now that you understand the workflow, you can use your own data to identify retail or market opportunities of your own.
