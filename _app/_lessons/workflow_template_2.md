# Identify Retail Opportunities by Location

Learn how to visualize new retail opportunities in New York City by building a real world map application. Use the Builder to analyze Starbucks stores located near busy NYC subways to identify Starbucks locations that receive the most foot traffic, and would be good candidates for promotional marketing campaign.

Analysis options covered in this lesson:

- Creating areas of influence
- Filtering points in polygons

Prerequisites: Familiarity with importing data to CARTO Builder and creating multi-layer map visualizations gained through [this lesson](tbd).

## Why Analyze your Location Data?

Understanding how to leverage your location-based intelligence into something that you can visualize enables you to gain key insights about your data that you may have otherwise missed.

[CARTO Builder](https://vimeo.com/173591785) not only enables you to enrich your map visualizations with location-based data, but also comes bundled with a wealth of analysis options to extract hidden insights from your data.

### Real World Problem: Starbucks

A common business problem is identifying new opportunities in reaching customers by location. This could mean everything from identifying new locations for retail stores to identifying stores that reach the most customers and could be a good target of promotional campaigns or testing of new products. 

### The Solution: Areas of Influence

With the CARTO Builder, the area of influence analysis option allows us to calculate the amount of travel time required by foot or car to reach a certain distance. By applying an area of influence analysis to our New York City subway locations, we can identify Starbucks locations located within 100 meters of a NYC subway. This allows us to identify Starbucks locations that potentially receive the greatest foot traffic.

## Building The Map

Create a map with two layers, by using the CARTO teams' public profile page to download a .carto file.

Connect the following datasets and create a map:
- NYC Subway stations dataset, `subways_stations_1_2`
- Starbucks locations in NYC dataset, `starbucks_2`
