# Advanced Styling with CartoCSS (WIP)

CartoCSS is the syntax language that enables you to customize the style of your map data. You can apply CartoCSS code from the STYLE options of a selected map layer in the CARTO Builder.

See CartoCSS Properties for a description of the available CartoCSS properties and values.

Tip: When an aggregation style is selected in the STYLE options for a map layer, an additional property appears in your CartoCSS code. This is useful as you can customize the entire aggregation style, using one syntax.


You are notified if there are any errors in the CartoCSS code. You can also click the undo and redo arrow buttons after entering code changes in the Builder.
